    "- Multiprocessing in Python refers to a programming technique that allows the execution of multiple processes concurrently. Each process runs in its separate memory space and has its Python interpreter. Unlike multithreading, which shares the same memory space, multiprocessing takes advantage of multiple CPU cores, enabling true parallel execution of tasks. The Python multiprocessing module provides support for creating and managing processes in a straightforward manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiprocessing is useful for CPU-bound tasks, where the computation time is the primary bottleneck. By utilizing multiple processes, it allows for better utilization of available CPU cores and significantly improves the performance of such tasks."

    "The main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory Space: \n",
    "    - In multiprocessing, each process has its separate memory space, while in multithreading, all threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CPU Utilization: \n",
    "    - Multiprocessing takes advantage of multiple CPU cores, achieving true parallelism, whereas multithreading, especially in CPython (due to the Global Interpreter Lock or GIL), doesn't fully utilize multiple cores for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Isolation: \n",
    "    - In multiprocessing, processes are isolated from each other, and each has its Python interpreter, making them independent of each other. In multithreading, threads can share data more easily but must be carefully synchronized to avoid race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complexity: \n",
    "    - Multithreading is generally simpler to implement and manage compared to multiprocessing, as shared resources need to be managed explicitly in multiprocessing to avoid issues like race conditions."
