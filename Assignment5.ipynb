    "- In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of objects with similar properties and functionalities. A class encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that define the behavior of its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that is created based on the class definition. Each object has its own unique state and can perform actions based on the methods defined in the class.\n",

    "#### Answer: The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Encapsulation:__ Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class. It helps in achieving data hiding and protecting data integrity by controlling access to the class members.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Inheritance:__ Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It enables the derived classes (subclasses) to inherit the properties and behaviors of the base class (superclass). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical organization of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Polymorphism:__ Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables methods to be implemented in different ways in different classes while still maintaining a common interface. Polymorphism enhances flexibility and extensibility in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Abstraction:__ Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex systems by representing the essential features and hiding unnecessary details. It involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define the common structure and behavior without providing specific implementation details."
